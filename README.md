# php-cms-project
My implementation of the project from the Udemy course "PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master - CMS Project"
https://www.udemy.com/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/learn/v4/overview

I mainly followed the chapters in the course and did implemented the proposed features in the best way possible.
I exported blocks of code that were found across different files in functions and tried to achieve a more widely-accepted implementation for some of the features (e.g. the post search form in the course was implemented using POST, however many of the implementations out there are using GET for search forms - both for accessebility and the lack of need to hide the search query from the user).
